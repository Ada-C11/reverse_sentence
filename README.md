# Reverse Sentence
In this assignment, you'll design and implement one of the well-known string manipulation methods.
Remember that a string is an array of characters. Algorithms that worked on restricted arrays will work on strings as well.

## Exercise
* Design and implement a method to reverse the words in a sentence *in place*. The string of words to be reversed in passed in as the input parameter to the method.
    * Your algorithm should strive to optimize the space complexity as much as possible.
* For example, if the method is called with input parameter of "Yoda&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;awesome", then the method should update the input string object to have the value "awesome&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yoda".
    * Note that the count of white spaces between words is preserved.
* Share and explain the time and space complexities for your solution in the comments above the method.
    * If the complexity is shared in terms of *n*, your explanation must explain what *n* stands for.

<b>Notes</b>:
    * Do not use Ruby provided functionality for `.reverse` and `.reverse!`.
    * You may use `.length` method available in the String class.
